# Mation

is, in short, a web frontend framework

- written in Purescript
- extending [the Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)<sup>([capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607012505/https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/))</sup> with...
- ... components (without getting overly complex! no lifetimes, no hooks, no `<slot>`, no messages, etc)
- ... more flexible I/O

(Mation has a bunch of other goodies as well, such as monoidal `Html`, flexible caching, and CSS selectors)


## Why you might like Mation

- You like Elm but think it over-simplifies

  Just as Purescript can be approximated as a more sophisticated version of Elm (the language), adding features like typeclasses and row polymorphism, Mation can be approximated as a more sophisticated version of Elm (the framework), adding features like components and (limited) stateful I/O.

- You like Elm but wish it supported component-based design

  Mation and Elm agree that traditional-style components (ala React, Vue) are overly-powerful. Elm shuns components entirely (see [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/webapps/structure.html)<sup>([capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607011043/https://guide.elm-lang.org/webapps/structure.html))</sup>, section *Components*); Mation on the other hand offers components but limits their power.

- You like React/Vue/Svelte/Halogen/etc but don't like how components have "standalone state", or feel that components are overly-complex.

- You want to use Purescript for front-end web development but don't like existing libraries


## Why you might *not* like Mation

- Your application is particularly performance sensitive or will contain a very large number of DOM nodes

  Mation is fast and has a flexible caching mechanism. However, its core loop is "update and globally rerender", meaning it's likely to fall behind in performance as compared to something with a tighter loop like Svelte. <small>(At the time of writing Mation has not been benchmarked against other frameworks)</small>

- You dislike lenses

  Mation uses lenses to compose components; this provides an extremeley flexible API. However, some people consider lenses a difficult or enigmatic topic, and error messages produced by lenses are generally hard to understand.

- You want something post-1.0 :P
