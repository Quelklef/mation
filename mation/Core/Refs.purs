-- | This module defines a select handful of mutable reference types.
-- | Each reference type supports some combination of the following four operations:
-- |
-- | - *read*, meaning that the reference can be read from
-- | - *write*, meaning that the reference can be written to
-- | - *modify*, meaning that one can apply a function of type `a -> a` to the reference's value
-- | - *listen*, meaning that one can listen for changes to the reference
-- |
-- | In particular, the following types are defined:
-- |
-- | - `ReadWriteL`, which is a read/write/modify/listen reference
-- | - `ReadWrite`, which is read/write/modify
-- | - `Modify`, which is write/modify
-- | - `Write`, which is write-only
-- | - `ReadL`, which is read/listen
-- | - `Read`, which is read-only
-- | - `Nil`, which supports none of the four operations
-- |
-- | Each reference type also comes with a *focus* operation, which gives a way
-- | to form "subreferences" (or "virtual references") which point to only a part
-- | of the state of the original reference.
-- |
-- | There is a `DowncastRef` class which gives you a way of turning
-- | a given reference (such as some read/write/modify `ReadWrite` value) into a
-- | less-powerful version (eg, into a write-only `Write` value)
-- |
-- | Each of the four operations *read*, *write*, *modify*, and *listen* are
-- | reified as a typeclass (eg `ReadRef`) which is instantiated by all
-- | ref types which support that operation.
-- |
-- | Ref types are coupled to the `Effect` monad. In principle it's possible
-- | possible to replace `Effect` by some type parameter `m` (and in earlier
-- | versions of the library, this was the case). However, these ref types
-- | exist in particular for use as Mation capabilities, in which case `m`
-- | will always be instantiated to `Effect` (since the Mation runtime lives
-- | in `Effect`)
-- |
-- | ***
-- |
-- | Now I will say a some mathy stuff.
-- |
-- | There are four possible operations that this module's reference types
-- | can support: *read*, *write*, *modify*, and *listen*. For completeness,
-- | this module ought to support every possible combination and hence
-- | provide 2⁴ = 16 different reference types. But it only provides 7.
-- | What gives? The answer comes in two parts.
-- |
-- | For one, not every combination of *read*, *write*, *modify*, and *listen*
-- | needs to be present for completeness. Notice that if you have a ref
-- | that supports *modify*, then you can also use it to *write*, by calling
-- | the `modify` function with an `a -> a` of the form `const newValue`.
-- | This means that supplying both a modify-only ref and a modify/write ref
-- | would be redundant, as they are in effect equivalent.
-- |
-- | Redundancies like this mean that, considering only the three operations
-- | *read*, *write*, and *modify*, there are exactly 5 different types of refs
-- | (rather than 2³ = 8); they are:
-- |
-- | - read/write (which can also *modify*)
-- | - modify (which can also *write*)
-- | - write
-- | - read
-- | - nil
-- |
-- | Regarding the *listen* operation, the situation is different. The *listen*
-- | operation actually has *no* redundancies, so if we wanted this module to
-- | be complete we should define 5 × 2 = 10 different ref types (one each
-- | of the five listed above, plus another version of each which also
-- | supports *listen*).
-- |
-- | However, we make the assumption that if you want to *listen* to a ref then
-- | you probably also want to *read* it; accordinly we only
-- | define *listen* versions of ref types which support *read*.

-- | Instantiated by reference types which support reading
class ReadRef ref where

class WriteRef ref where
  write :: forall m a. MonadEffect m => a -> ref a -> m Unit

-- | Instantiated by reference types which support the *modify* operation
class ModifyRef ref where
  modify :: forall m a. MonadEffect m => (a -> a) -> ref a -> m Unit

-- | Instantiated by reference types which support registering change
-- | listeners.
-- |
-- | Listeners are notified that an update occurred but *not* what the new
-- | value of the reference is. To find that, they must read the ref themselves.
-- |
-- | Listeners are removed after they are fired. To listen to every change of
-- | a `ListenRef` ref, a callsite must repeatedly re-attach its listener
-- | (or use `onChange`).
-- |
-- | `ReadRef` is a superclass of `ListenRef`. This is "artificial" in the
-- | sense that one cannot recover `read` from `onNextChange`. However, almost
-- | always if one wants to know when a ref value changes, then they also
-- | want to know what the value changes *to*; hence, it's appropriate to
-- | couple the two classes.

  onNextChange :: forall m a. MonadUnliftEffect m => m Unit -> ref a -> m Unit

-- | Instances give a way to construct a reference type in some fixed monad `m`
--
-- This is the only way we allow a library user to create new references.
-- In principle we could supply constructors like `mkRead :: m a -> Read m a`.
-- But since we lack any laws for reference values, that could result
-- in the creation of "bad" references, such as a `Write a` which does
-- not write to a mutable location (but instead eg emits an event).
class MakeRef ref where

  -- | Create a reference which can close over itself
  --
  -- This is safe because using a reference in any way is a monadic action,
  -- and `ref a -> a` is not monadic. Hence the `ref a -> a` function cannot
  -- actually use the ref, it can only place the reference somewhere.

-- | Reference types who can `focus` with a `Lens'`
-- |
-- | There is a `FocusRefWithX` class for various choice
-- | of `X`. This is less pretty than having a single `FocusRefWith`
-- | (with instances like `FocusRefWith Lens' ReadWrite`), but
-- | for technical reasons that's not possible/desirable.
--
-- Namely, the technical reasons are these. Say we wanted a class
--
--   class FocusRefWith len ref where
--     focus :: forall m s a. len s a -> ref m s -> ref m a
--
-- This won't work. Purescript will reject instances
-- like `FocusRefWith Lens' ReadWrite` because Lens' is not a type
-- constructor.
--
-- In the future we might (see [1]) be able to fix this by adding a
-- fundep `ref -> len`. But then we can't have both instances
--
--   FocusRefWith Setter' Modify
--   FocusRefWith Lens' Modify
--
-- which is bad. This is bad because it makes stuff like the following
-- fail:
--
--   duplicate :: forall m ref a. FocusRefWith Lens' ref =>
--     Html m (ref a) -> Html m (ref (a /\ a))
--   duplicate html = fold
--     [ cmap (focusWithLens _1) html
--     , cmap (focusWithLens _2) html
--     ]
--
-- If Modify is only allowed the instance `FocusRefWith Setter' Modify`,
-- then trying to choose `ref ~ Modify` in the above will fail
-- at instance resolution.

-- | An instance of `DowncastRef r1 r2` gives a way to transform a reference
-- | of type `r1` into a reference of type `r2`.
-- |
-- | Downcasting commutes with read/write/modify/listen operations; for
-- | instance, `ref # write v` is the same as `(downcast ref) # write v`.
-- |
-- | Every reference type can be downcast to itself.
-- |

-- | ```
-- |
-- | Differs from creating a two-way binding with `onChange` and `push` in
-- | that bindings created with `sync` will not self-invoke.
-- |
-- | ***
-- |
-- | A first attempt at creating a two-way sync is to use `onChange` for
-- | one direction of the sync (or `onChange'`) and `write` for the other
-- | direction of the sync.
-- |
-- | The trouble with this is that it causes unnecessary round-tripping.
-- | When the non-`ref` state changes, it will invoke `write`, which
-- | will invoke the `onChange` listener, which is redundant. Likewise,
-- | when the `ref` state changes, it will invoke the `onChange` listener,
-- | which will update the non-`ref` state, which will invoke `write`,
-- | which is redundant.
-- |
-- | In fact, if one uses `onChange` this should cause an infinite loop.
-- | (The other option is to use `onChange'` and using `==` to test in
-- | the listener for if the state has actually changed)
-- |
-- | The value add of `sync` is that it avoids this round-tripping. You
-- | pass in a `listen :: a -> Effect Unit` (as you would to `onChange`)
-- | and recieve a `tell :: a -> Effect Unit` (akin to `write`) and
-- | when they are invoked they will avoid invoking the other.
